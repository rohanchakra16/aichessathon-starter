# Where the strength comes from

The rules require that a learned model materially drives move selection, so the shape of a
competitive agent is a search that calls a model. This is what tends to matter, roughly in order.

## Search

Negamax with alpha-beta is the whole game. The gap between the `minimax` baseline and something
respectable is mostly move ordering, because alpha-beta only pays off when good moves come first.

- Order captures before quiet moves, and order captures by MVV-LVA.
- Keep a transposition table. Even a plain dict keyed on `board._transposition_key()` and cleared
  between moves is worth a ply.
- Iterative deepening: search depth 1, then 2, then 3, keeping the best move from each pass. It
  gives you ordering for free and, more importantly, it gives you something to return when time
  runs out.
- Quiescence search at the leaves, captures only. Without it your evaluation is measured in
  positions that are mid-exchange and it will be wrong.

You are on one core in Python, so node counts are small: expect thousands, not millions. That
changes the trade. Depth is expensive, so evaluation quality and ordering buy more than they
would in a C engine.

## Evaluation

Material plus piece-square tables is a real evaluation and it beats both baselines. It is also
the thing to build first, because it gives you a reference to measure a model against.

The base image ships torch and onnxruntime, so a small network is practical. Export to ONNX and
run it with onnxruntime: startup is faster than torch and inference on one core is competitive.
Keep it small. A net you can evaluate thousands of times per move is worth more than a better net
you can evaluate fifty times.

Batching helps: collect the leaf positions of a search pass and evaluate them in one call rather
than one at a time.

## Training data

You have no network at runtime, so everything ships in the zip inside the 50 MB budget. Data
gathering happens on your machine, before you upload. Public game databases and self-play against
your own earlier versions are both reasonable starting points. Whatever you train on, the model
has to be yours.

## Time management

120 seconds plus 0.5 per move. A flag is a loss, and it is the most common self-inflicted one.

- Budget per move from the clock you were handed, not from a constant. Something like
  `time_left_ms / max(20, expected_moves_left)` is enough to start.
- Check the clock inside your search, not only between moves, and return the best move you have
  when the budget is gone. Iterative deepening makes that easy.
- Leave a margin. The referee measures wall time, and the watchdog does not forgive.

## Things the position alone does not tell you

The process stays alive between your moves, so you can keep state. Two things are worth keeping:

- The positions you have been asked about. The referee claims threefold repetition automatically,
  so if you are winning and shuffling, you can draw a won game without ever being told.
- Your own search results. A transposition table that survives across moves is a real gain.

An opening book, even twenty lines deep, saves clock and avoids the early blunders that cost more
than any evaluation improvement.

## Measuring a change

Two games tell you nothing. Alternate colours, fix the opponent, and play enough games that the
score means something: a change worth 3% needs hundreds of games to see, and `make arena` at a
fast time control is how you get them. Keep the previous version around as an opponent, because
"better than my last one" is the only comparison that matters.

## What loses games for free

- Flagging. See above.
- Crashing on an edge case: no legal moves, a promotion, an en passant capture. Play a few hundred
  games against a random baseline and the rare paths show up.
- Blowing the 60 second import budget loading weights.
- Writing outside `/tmp`, which is read-only and will not be what you expect.
- More threads than cores. `torch.set_num_threads(1)`.
